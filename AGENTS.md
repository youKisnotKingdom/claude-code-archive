## Critical Rules (Read First)

**Language**:

- Code, comments, and commit messages should be in English

**NEVER**:

- Use `as` type casting in ANY context including test code (explain the problem to the user instead)
- Use raw `fetch` or bypass TanStack Query for API calls
- Run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start` (dev servers)
- Use `node:fs`, `node:path`, etc. directly (use Effect-TS equivalents)

**ALWAYS**:

- Use Effect-TS for all backend side effects
- Use Hono RPC + TanStack Query for all API calls
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implement
- Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm fix` before committing

## Commit Message Rules

Conventional Commits format: `type: description`

**Release Note Awareness**:

- Commit messages are included in release notes; write for users.

**Type Selection**:
| Type | Release Note | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `feat` | Features | User-facing new feature |
| `fix` | Bug Fixes | User-impacting bug fix |
| `chore`, `ci`, `build`, `refactor` | Excluded | Internal changes |

**Critical**: Use `fix` only for user-facing bugs. Internal fixes (linter errors, type errors, build scripts) must use `chore`.

**Message Quality Examples**:

- Bad: `fix: fix lingui error` (internal issue)
- Bad: `feat: add button` (too vague)
- Good: `feat: add dark mode toggle to settings`
- Good: `fix: session list not updating after deletion`
- Good: `chore: update lingui compiled messages`

## Project Overview

Claude Code Viewer reads Claude Code session logs directly from JSONL files (`~/.claude/projects/`) with zero data loss. It's a web-based client built as a CLI tool serving a Vite application.

**Core Architecture**:

- Frontend: Vite + TanStack Router + React 19 + TanStack Query
- Backend: Hono (standalone server) + Effect-TS (all business logic)
- Data: Direct JSONL reads with strict Zod validation
- Real-time: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates

## Recommended Coding Process

This project is designed with the philosophy of achieving both rapid feedback and code quality maintenance (passing checks = nearly guaranteed runtime correctness) by leveraging:

- Strict typing with Effect-TS and ADT
- Constraints for maintaining code quality configured in Lint as much as possible
- Dependency injection and effective testing with Effect-TS

For development, we recommend implementing with t-wada's TDD development style.

For checks, you can run `pnpm gatecheck check` to execute all the above checks against the diff at once, so proceed with implementation in a loop of problem detection and fixing with gatecheck.

By utilizing this, you can quickly inspect code with static checks and unit tests.

## Quality Gate (MUST follow)

After changing source code, always run before committing:

```bash
pnpm gatecheck check
./scripts/lingui-check.sh
```

## Key Directory Patterns

- `src/server/hono/route.ts` - Hono API routes definition (all routes defined here)
- `src/server/core/` - Effect-TS business logic (domain modules: session, project, git, etc.)
- `src/lib/conversation-schema/` - Zod schemas for JSONL validation
- `src/testing/layers/` - Reusable Effect test layers (`testPlatformLayer` is the foundation)
- `src/routes/` - TanStack Router routes

## Coding Standards

### Backend: Effect-TS

**Prioritize Pure Functions**:

- Extract logic into pure, testable functions whenever possible
- Pure functions are easier to test, reason about, and maintain
- Only use Effect-TS when side effects or state management is required

**Use Effect-TS for Side Effects and State**:

- Mandatory for I/O operations, async code, and stateful logic
- Avoid class-based implementations or mutable variables for state
- Use Effect-TS's functional patterns for state management
- Reference: https://effect.website/llms.txt

**Testing with Layers**:

```typescript
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { Effect } from "effect";
import { testPlatformLayer } from "@/testing/layers";
import { yourEffect } from "./your-module";

test("example", async () => {
  const result = await Effect.runPromise(yourEffect.pipe(Effect.provide(testPlatformLayer)));
  expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
});
```

**Avoid Node.js Built-ins**:

- Use `FileSystem.FileSystem` instead of `node:fs`
- Use `Path.Path` instead of `node:path`
- Use `Command.string` instead of `child_process`

This enables dependency injection and proper testing.

**Type Safety - NO `as` Casting**:

- `as` casting is **strictly prohibited**
- If types seem unsolvable without `as`, explain the problem to the user and ask for guidance
- Valid alternatives: type guards, assertion functions, Zod schema validation

### Frontend: API Access

**Hono RPC + TanStack Query Only**:

```typescript
import { api } from "@/lib/api";
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["example"],
  queryFn: () => api.endpoint.$get().then((res) => res.json()),
});
```

Raw `fetch` and direct requests are prohibited.

### Tech Standards

- **Linter/Formatter**: oxlint + oxfmt (not ESLint/Prettier/Biome)
- **Type Config**: `@tsconfig/strictest`
- **Path Alias**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

## Architecture Details

### SSE (Server-Sent Events)

**When to Use SSE**:

- Delivering session log updates to frontend
- Notifying clients of background process state changes
- **Never** for request-response patterns (use Hono RPC instead)

**Implementation**:

- Server: `/api/sse` endpoint with type-safe events (`TypeSafeSSE`)
- Client: `useServerEventListener` hook for subscriptions

### Data Layer

- **Single Source of Truth**: `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl`
- **Cache**: `~/.claude-code-viewer/` (invalidated via SSE when source changes)
- **Validation**: Strict Zod schemas ensure every field is captured

### Session Process Management

Claude Code processes remain alive in the background (unless aborted), allowing session continuation without changing session-id.

## Development Tips

1. **Session Logs**: Examine `~/.claude/projects/` JSONL files to understand data structures
2. **Mock Data**: `mock-global-claude-dir/` contains E2E test mocks (useful reference for schema examples)
3. **Effect-TS Help**: https://effect.website/llms.txt
