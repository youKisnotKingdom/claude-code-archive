## Important Notice: Agent SDK and Subscription Usage

> [!WARNING]
> As of April 2026, Anthropic's [Terms of Service](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance#authentication-and-credential-use) prohibit using the Agent SDK to **send chat messages** with a subscription account. While Anthropic's X/Twitter announcements suggested personal use may be acceptable, the boundary between permitted and prohibited use remains ambiguous.
>
> In response, **chat sending, session resuming, permission approval, and `AskUserQuestion`** have been made opt-in.
>
> Note that real-time conversation log viewing, session history browsing, Git operations, and all other read-oriented features are implemented independently of the Agent SDK and remain fully available regardless of your authentication mode. You can start a Claude Code session from the CLI (or the built-in terminal) and watch it live in Claude Code Viewer without any restrictions.

### Choosing Your Authentication Mode

On first launch (or from the Settings screen), you will be prompted to select your authentication method:

- **API Key** (default) — Uses the Anthropic API directly. All features, including chat sending, are fully available.
- **Subscription** — Opts out of Agent SDK chat features. The chat input switches to a copy mode: configure your session options in the form, then click the **Copy** button to get the equivalent `claude` CLI command with the corresponding arguments already set. Paste and run it in any terminal to start or resume your session. Once the session is running, Claude Code Viewer will display the conversation in real-time as usual.

### Built-in Terminal

Claude Code Viewer includes an integrated terminal emulator accessible via the **panel at the bottom of the screen**. Open it, paste the copied command, and launch Claude Code without ever leaving the browser.

## Introduction

Claude Code Viewer is a web-based Claude Code client focused on **comprehensive session log analysis**. It preserves and organizes all conversation data through strict schema validation and a progressive disclosure UI that reveals details on demand.

**Core Philosophy**: Zero data loss + Effective organization + Remote-friendly design

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 22.13.0 or later
- **Claude Code**: v1.0.125 or later
- **Operating Systems**: macOS and Linux (Windows is not supported)

## Installation & Usage

### Quick Start (CLI)

Run directly from npm without installation:

```bash
npx @kimuson/claude-code-viewer@latest --port 3400
```

Alternatively, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @kimuson/claude-code-viewer
claude-code-viewer --port 3400
```

The server will start on port 3400 (or the default port 3000). Open `http://localhost:3400` in your browser to access the interface.

**Available Options:**

```bash
claude-code-viewer [options]

Options:
  -p, --port <port>                Port to listen on (default: 3000)
  -h, --hostname <hostname>        Hostname to listen on (default: localhost)
  -v, --verbose                    Enable verbose debug logging
  -P, --password <password>        Password for authentication
  -e, --executable <executable>    Path to Claude Code executable
  --claude-dir <claude-dir>        Path to Claude directory
  --api-only                       Run in API-only mode without Web UI
```

### Remote Access via Tailscale (Mobile / PWA)

Claude Code Viewer works great as a persistent server you access from your phone. A convenient approach is to run it on a always-on machine and expose it over [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) with HTTPS:

1. **Set up HTTPS on your Tailscale node** following the [Tailscale HTTPS certificates guide](https://tailscale.com/docs/how-to/set-up-https-certificates).
2. **Start Claude Code Viewer** bound to all interfaces with a password:

   ```bash
   claude-code-viewer --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 3400 --password your-secret
   ```

3. **Access from your phone** via the Tailscale HTTPS URL (e.g. `https://your-machine.ts.net:3400`).

Claude Code Viewer is a **PWA (Progressive Web App)**. On mobile, tap "Add to Home Screen" to get an app-like experience with an optimized UI and push notifications when sessions complete.

| `--terminal-disabled`           | `CCV_TERMINAL_DISABLED`     | Disable the in-app terminal panel when set to `1`/`true` (env) or when the flag is present (CLI)                                                                                                                                                                                                               | (unset)       |
| `--terminal-shell <path>`       | `CCV_TERMINAL_SHELL`        | Shell executable for terminal sessions (e.g. `/bin/zsh`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | (auto-detect) |

| `--api-only`                    | `CCV_API_ONLY`              | Run in API-only mode. Disables Web UI, terminal WebSocket, and non-essential endpoints. Only core API routes (`/api/version`, `/api/config`, `/api/projects`, `/api/claude-code`, `/api/search`, `/api/sse`) are exposed. Useful for integrating with external tools like n8n                                  | (unset)       |

**Breaking Change**: Environment variable names have been changed. If you're using environment variables, update them as follows:

- `CLAUDE_CODE_VIEWER_AUTH_PASSWORD` → `CCV_PASSWORD`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_VIEWER_CC_EXECUTABLE_PATH` → `CCV_CC_EXECUTABLE_PATH`
- New environment variable added: `CCV_GLOBAL_CLAUDE_DIR` (previously the Claude directory path was hardcoded to `~/.claude`)

### API Authentication

When `--password` / `CCV_PASSWORD` is set, all `/api` routes (except auth-related endpoints) require authentication. You can authenticate in two ways:

1. **Session cookie**: Use the `/api/auth/login` endpoint to set the `ccv-session` cookie, then include it in subsequent requests.
2. **Authorization header**: Send `Authorization: Bearer <password>` on each request.

If no password is configured, API authentication is disabled.

### User Settings

Settings can be configured from the sidebar in Claude Code Viewer.

| Hide sessions without user messages  | true                         | Claude Code creates logs for operations like `/compact` that aren't tied to actual tasks, which can create noise. When enabled, sessions without user messages are hidden.                                                                                                                    |
| Unify sessions with same title       | false                        | When resuming, Claude Code creates a new session with regenerated conversation logs. When enabled, only the latest session with the same title is displayed.                                                                                                                                  |
| Auto-schedule Continue on Rate Limit | false                        | Automatically schedules a continue message when Claude hits rate limits. When enabled, the system detects rate limit errors in live sessions and creates a scheduled job to send "continue" one minute after the limit reset time. This prevents manual intervention for rate limit recovery. |
| Enter Key Behavior                   | Shift+Enter                  | Specifies which key combination sends messages.

## Data Source

The application reads Claude Code conversation logs from:

- **Location**: `~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session-id>.jsonl`
- **Format**: JSONL files containing conversation entries
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically discovers new projects and sessions

> [!NOTE]
> **30 Day Session Cleanup Default:** Claude Code defaults to auto-delete all session transcripts older than 30 days. Claude Code Viewer does not make backups of your session files so when the `.jsonl` files get deleted those sessions will no longer exist in Claude Code Viewer. To override the 30 day retention default, add [`cleanupPeriodDays`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings) with a number greater than 30 in `~/.claude/settings.json` and restart Claude Code.
>
> ```json
> {
>   "cleanupPeriodDays": 365
> }
> ```

## Internationalization (i18n)

Claude Code Viewer currently supports **English**, **Japanese**, and **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**. Adding new languages is straightforward—simply add a new `messages.json` file for your locale (see [src/i18n/locales/](./src/i18n/locales/) for examples).

If you'd like support for your language, please open an issue—we'll add it quickly!

## Alternatives & Differentiation

### Official Solution: Claude Code on the Web

Anthropic provides [Claude Code on the Web](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude-code-on-the-web), which runs Claude Code sessions in Anthropic's cloud VMs. Each session clones your repository and executes predefined setup commands (e.g., `pnpm install`).

**When to use Claude Code on the Web**:

- Quick testing without local setup or self-hosting infrastructure
- Casual development from mobile devices or public computers
- Simple repository structures with single CLAUDE.md at the root

**When to use Claude Code Viewer**:

- Working with pre-configured local environments (databases, services, large dependencies)
- Monorepo projects with multiple CLAUDE.md files in different directories
- Development requiring significant computational resources or long-running processes
- Preference for self-hosted infrastructure with full control over the development environment

### Community Web Clients

Several excellent community-built web clients exist:

- https://github.com/sugyan/claude-code-webuisupport
- https://github.com/wbopan/cui
- https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui

**What Makes Claude Code Viewer Different**: While these tools excel as general-purpose web clients, Claude Code Viewer is specifically designed as a **session log viewer** with:

- **Zero Information Loss**: Strict Zod schema validation ensures every conversation detail is preserved
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Expandable elements and sub-session modals help manage information density
- **Built-in Git Operations**: Comprehensive diff viewer with direct commit functionality for remote development workflows
- **Session Flow Analysis**: Complete conversation tracking across multiple sessions
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time version and feature compatibility monitoring
- **International Accessibility**: Multi-language support for global development teams

Each tool serves different use cases—choose the one that best fits your workflow and priorities.

## Remote Development

Claude Code Viewer is designed with remote hosting in mind. To support remote development workflows, it includes:

- **Mobile-Optimized UI**: Responsive interface with dedicated mobile sidebar and touch-optimized controls
- **Built-in Git Operations**: Review and commit changes directly from the web interface
- **Real-time Notifications**: Audio notifications for task completion to maintain workflow awareness
- **System Monitoring**: Monitor Claude Code compatibility and feature availability across environments

The application features a separated client-server architecture that enables remote hosting. **Basic password authentication is available** via the `--password` command-line option or `CCV_PASSWORD` environment variable. When set, users must authenticate with the configured password before accessing the application. However, this is a simple single-password authentication mechanism without advanced features like multi-user support, role-based access control, or OAuth integration. If you require more sophisticated authentication, carefully evaluate your security requirements and implement appropriate access controls at the infrastructure level (e.g., reverse proxy with OAuth, VPN, IP whitelisting).
